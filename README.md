# SUDOKU
A brief project to develop a program capable of solving sudoku challenges completed between 4 Imperial College London students
This will be used to collate all the scripts we've made so only make changes to this once everyone has agreed.
The project challanges the ability to work in a team while all members are spread throughout the UK.
